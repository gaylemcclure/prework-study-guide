# Prework Study Guide

## Description

Often when learning and studying, notes can be written either by hand or on a local computer. The issue with this is that if you are not at your desk or computer, you aren't able to access those notes. 
This study guide was built to eliminate that by allowing students to add their notes to their project while they are learning, and have the ability to access them online at any time. 

There are four specific topics, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Git, the students are able to add their own notes via index.html in the relevant section, and once deployed, they are always accessible. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
